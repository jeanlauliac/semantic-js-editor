# Semantic JS Editor Roadmap

In chronological order:

* Edition of simple arithmetic expressions. Writing an expression from scratch.
  Being able to change sub-trees, select them, possibly move them around.
* Edition of the Javascript language in a way similar to writing text.
* Typeahead.
* Smarter features, such as automatic `import` statement insertion, etc.
