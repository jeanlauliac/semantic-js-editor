# semantic-js-editor

Just getting started. This is a component that will allow the edition of JS code
based primarily on the AST (rather than flat text).

## Development

Run:

    ./build.js

It takes some time to build from scratch. Once started, it will update anytime
a source file change. You can check out the editor at
[`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080).
